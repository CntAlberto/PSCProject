# Formal models for production systems controls
Provided three case of studies of three models for the solution of a production line control. The problem is discussed with the examples of the teacher that need to satisfies two or more students. Project for the course Production Systems Control

## Conditions and starting data
Consider two students in a class-room “using” the single teacher, in the sense that each asks a question and is answered. When a student wants to pose a question, he calls the teacher’s attention by raising his  hand and waits to be allowed to speak. Once the teacher gives his permission, the conversation continues until the student is satisfied.

## First case of study
Specifications: <br>
- the two users should not use the resource simultaneously and each user should always be able to repeat its request-use-release cycle; <br>
- the user that first requests the resource should also be first granted access to it; <br>

## Second case of study
Specifications: <br>
- the two users should not use the resource simultaneously and each user should always be able to repeat its request-use-release cycle; <br>
- the user that first requests the resource should also be first granted access to it; <br>
To satisy the two specifications change model and use the Modular Approach

## Third case of study
Specifications: <br>
- the two users should not use the resource simultaneously and each user should always be able to repeat its request-use-release cycle; <br>
- the user that first requests the resource should also be first granted access to it; <br>
